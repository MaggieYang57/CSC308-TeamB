### Code Styles
We are using ESLint and Prettier. Developers should use ESLint to check syntax, find quality problems and bugs, and enforce a uniform code style. Intergrating Prettier simultaneously formats the code to help enforce a consistent style as well.

Any code contributors should following the guide https://codeburst.io/eslint-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enforcing-a-style-guide-with-eslint-d4520c732dcb.

Our team chose to use the **Standard** style guide for this project.
We initialized .eslintrc.js files for both frontend and backend with the exact same settings.

To automatically apply Prettier rules for all files, run npx prettier --write .
