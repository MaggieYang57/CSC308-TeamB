### Code Styles
We are using ESLint and Prettier.

Any code contributors should following the guide https://codeburst.io/eslint-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enforcing-a-style-guide-with-eslint-d4520c732dcb.

Our team chose to use the **Standard** style guide for this project.
We initialized .eslintrc.js files for both frontend and backend with the exact same settings.

To automatically apply Prettier rules for all files in src, run npx prettier --write src/* .js . To run it for components, run  npx prettier --write src/**/* .js
